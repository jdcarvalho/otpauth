### Two-Factor Authentication with OTP Repository

This repository provides a comprehensive implementation in Django of two-factor 
authentication (2FA) using one-time passwords (OTP). 
The goal of this project is to be a proof of concept to enhance the 
security of user authentication by adding an additional 
layer of verification beyond traditional 
username/password combinations.

Overall, this repository serves as a robust solution for implementing 
two-factor authentication with OTPs in Django, enhancing the security posture
of applications and protecting user accounts from unauthorized access.

The diagram below shows the typical OTP flow.
